# USB-C PD adapter for QMX + 50W PA

The QMX-PowerplAy is designed to power the [QRP Labs QMX](https://qrp-labs.com/qmx.html) as well as the [50W PA](https://qrp-labs.com/50wpa.html) off a USB PD Powerbank.
Designed for ultimate portability for SOTA / POTA activations, the board can negotiate `15V` or `20V` with `3A` or `5A` for the PA.
A `12V, 5A` switching regulator powers the QMX. Power Negotiation can be selected with simple Jumpers.
